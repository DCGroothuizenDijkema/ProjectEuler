# Problem 6: Sum square difference

[Problem page](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6)

## Problem Statement

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

## Solution

This problem is trivially solved by knowing to simple results of arithmetic:

First, that the sum of all natural numbers up to and including `n` is given by `n*(n+1)/2`.

Second, that the sum of all squared natural numbers up to and including `n` is given by `n*(n+1)*(2*n+1)/6`.
